A program to tag images in multiple folders in order to sort through them more granularly, by certain topics.  This will help to

# Future Plans:
-Metro-style dark UI with a layout similar to Windows Explorer. <br>
-Ability to browse for folders to add to a registry. <br>
-Within each folder, view all images and allow the user to multi-select them.<br>
-The user can create tags in a global collection, and add tags to selected images.<br>
-User can search for images by their tags throughout all folders in the registry.<br>
-User can open selected images in Windows Photo Viewer.<br>
-If a user moves an image from a watched folder into another watched folder during runtime, update the tags for the new file name.<br>
-If a user moves an image from a watched folder into another watched folder while the program is not running, check all filepaths and compare all watched files that do not exist to new files that do exist, and allow user to choose whether the likely moved image really was moved or not, and they want to transfer the tags.<br>
-Simple folder tree to let user navigate through the filesystem in some way, like Windows Explorer.<br>
  -View folders and their subfolders.<br>
  -When viewing images in the selected folder, show all subfolders in the image selection view as well.<br>
